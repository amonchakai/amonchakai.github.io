              <h3>General information</h3>
 
              <p>
              HFR10 is an application developed by a member of the forum "forum.hardware.fr" (HFR), and not by the team of the website. In case you would have a question, want a new feature, or report a bug. Please contact me (Amonchakai) either using a private message on the forum or by posting on the appropriate page in the forum:

              <h3>Access to the source code: </h3>
              <p>
              The application is an open-source project under the GNU GPL licence. You can access to the code, edit it, modify it. </p>

              <h3>Privacy: </h3>
              <p>
              No information regarding password is stored inside the application. The handling of login is done using cookies provided by forum.hardware.fr. These cookies are stored in a non-encrypted manner inside the application. The user name is also stored in the application in an un-encrypted manner. This is meant only to allow showing the user name in the setting page. When the user asks explicitly to disconnect, both the cookies and the text file containing the user name will be deleted. <br/>
              As additional information, the avatars of the user will be stored inside the application. This is meant to avoid downloading them too frequently. No other information will be stored inside the application. <br/><br/>
              No private information is stored by the application. It only shows the content available on the forum. Your personal information on the forum and accessible via the application, e.g. your private message, will never be stored nor divulgated to anybody or any entity.</p>
 
 
              <h3>Permission: </h3>
              <p>
              The application will request several permissions
              <UL TYPE=\"circle\">
              <LI> access to your files: this is just meant to allow you to upload images to the image hosting service of HFR. In case you would decide to reject this permission, only the feature allowing you to upload images will be affected. The application will still be able to work normally. 
              <LI>run a task in background: this is meant to enable the HUB integration. The background task will check your private messages every N minute. The value of N, can be defined in the settings of the application. It ranges from one minute to two hours. The default value is 5 minutes. If you decide not to give this permission to the application, the application will not appear in the HUB. The other features will not be affected by this choice. 
              </UL>
